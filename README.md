# Waze Data Science Project

The **Waze Data Science Project** involves analyzing traffic data from the Waze app to gain insights into traffic patterns, identify congestion hotspots, and predict future traffic conditions. By applying machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis, the project aims to improve traffic flow management and provide actionable insights for urban planners and commuters. 

The project leverages large datasets, including real-time traffic updates and historical traffic data, to build predictive models that can help optimize travel routes and reduce congestion.
